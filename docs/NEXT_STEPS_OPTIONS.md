## üéØ My Recommendation: Option A (Frontend Integration)

**Why?**

1. **Completes the FTS5 Feature** - We built a powerful search API but users can't use it yet!
2. **High Immediate Impact** - Users will see instant search, autocomplete, advanced filters
3. **Builds on Recent Work** - Leverage the 10.6x performance improvement we just achieved
4. **Quick Win** - 8-10 hours for a complete, polished feature
5. **User Satisfaction** - Search is the #1 requested feature in product roadmap

**What Users Will Get:**
```
Before: Basic filter dropdowns, slow search
After:  Google-like instant search with autocomplete,
        Boolean operators, phrase search, 10.6x faster
```

**Next After This:**
Once frontend integration is complete, I'd recommend:
- **Option B** (UI/UX Improvements) to polish the application
- **Option D** (Production Prep) to deploy to users
- **Option C** (Relationships) only if needed after production usage
