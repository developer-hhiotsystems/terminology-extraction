### **After Integration:**
- ✅ All routes added to App.tsx
- ✅ Navigation links added with icons
- ✅ All components are accessible
- ✅ TypeScript build passes cleanly
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ API client has all necessary methods
- ✅ Backend router included in app.py

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### **Phase A (Search):**
- Autocomplete only works in Simple mode (by design)
- Language filter options hardcoded (should fetch from API)

### **Phase B (Enhanced Glossary):**
- Domain filter empty by default (needs backend data)
- Bulk export only supports JSON (CSV/Excel TODO)
- Some optional fields (page_numbers, confidence_score) may not be populated

### **Phase C (Relationships):**
- spaCy model (`en_core_web_sm`) must be installed manually
- Graph may be slow with >2000 nodes on mobile
- No relationships will show until you run extraction
- Extraction speed depends on definition length (2-5 entries/second)

**Installation of spaCy model (if needed):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## 🎓 What You Learned

**The Problem:**
- Components were created but never integrated
- Documentation said "complete" but features were invisible
- Users couldn't access any of the work that was done

**The Root Cause:**
- Missing routes in App.tsx
- Missing navigation links
- Missing API methods in client
- Missing backend router inclusion
- Type definition mismatches

**The Solution:**
- Systematic integration of all components
- Proper routing and navigation
- API client completion
- Backend router wiring
- Type definition updates
- TypeScript error resolution

**Key Takeaway:**
Creating components is only half the work - they must be **wired up and integrated** to be useful to users!
