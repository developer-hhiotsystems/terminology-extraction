## Manual Verification Commands

### Test Backend Server
```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
python src/backend/app.py
```
- Expected: Server starts on http://localhost:8000
- Visit: http://localhost:8000/health
- Expected response:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "database": "not_connected",
    "neo4j": "not_connected"
  }
  ```

### Test Frontend Server
```bash
npm start
```
- Expected: Browser opens at http://localhost:3000
- Should see: "Welcome to Glossary App" with dark theme

### Test Python Tests
```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
pytest tests/unit/test_example.py -v
```
- Expected: 2/2 tests pass

### Test Neo4j (After Docker installation)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
curl http://localhost:7474
```
- Expected: HTML response from Neo4j Browser

## NPM Vulnerabilities Status

### Current Status: 14 vulnerabilities
- 2 low severity
- 3 moderate severity
- 9 high severity

### Analysis:
Most vulnerabilities are in:
1. **react-scripts** (dev dependency) - false positives for production
2. **@pact-foundation/pact** - contract testing tool (dev only)
3. **webpack-dev-server** - development server (not used in production)

### Action Taken:
- Ran `npm audit fix` - resolved 0 issues (breaking changes required)
- Remaining issues are acceptable for development

### Recommendation:
- **For development**: Current state is acceptable
- **For production**: Build process excludes dev dependencies
- **If needed**: Run `npm audit fix --force` (may break functionality)

## Decision Point

### Option 1: Start Phase 1 Development Now ✓
**You can proceed immediately with:**
- Core API development
- Basic UI components
- Unit test scaffolding
- SQLite database schema

**Postpone until Phase 2:**
- NLP extraction (needs spaCy)
- Graph visualization (needs Neo4j)
- IATE validation (needs dataset)
- Translation features (needs DeepL API)

### Option 2: Complete Full Setup First
**Complete remaining tasks:**
1. Install C++ Build Tools (30-45 min)
2. Install Docker Desktop (15-30 min)
3. Configure DeepL API (5-10 min)
4. Download IATE dataset (10-15 min)

**Then proceed with full Phase 1 capabilities**

---

## Recommendation

**START PHASE 1 NOW** - Current setup is sufficient for:
- Weeks 1-2: Core infrastructure
- Basic CRUD operations
- File upload scaffolding
- Frontend layout and routing
- Unit test framework

**Complete remaining setup during Week 2** - Install before:
- Week 3-4: NLP extraction (needs spaCy)
- Week 5-6: Graph database (needs Neo4j)

This approach maximizes parallel development time.
