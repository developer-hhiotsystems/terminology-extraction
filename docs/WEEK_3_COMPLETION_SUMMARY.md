- ✅ Article prefixes stripped DURING extraction
- ✅ PDF artifacts rejected BEFORE database
- ✅ Tests prove the pipeline prevents 1,299+ bad terms

### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Every Week 2 change is now tested:
- `_normalize_ocr_artifacts()` - 13 tests
- `strip_leading_articles()` - 12 tests
- Week 2 validator methods - 15 tests
- Real-world examples from cleanup script

### 3. **Automated Quality Gates**
CI/CD pipeline ensures:
- ✅ All 91 tests run on every commit
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verified
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities scanned
