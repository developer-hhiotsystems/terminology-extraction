| 60 | New Product | ❌ Generic phrase | Not a technical term |

### Type 3: Generic Phrases

| # | Term | Issue | Assessment |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| 18 | Many Scenarios | ❌ Generic phrase | Not a term, just a phrase |
| 44 | At Least 5 | ❌ Quantifier phrase | Extracted from measurement context |
| 51 | All Parameters | ❌ Generic phrase | Too broad to be useful |
| 56 | Different Scenarios | ❌ Generic phrase | Similar to #18 |
| 73 | Various Types | ❌ Generic phrase | Meaningless without object |

### Type 4: Valid But Context-Dependent

| # | Term | Status | Notes |

## Recommendations Priority Matrix

### CRITICAL (Must Fix - P0)
1. **Preprocessing:** Clean line breaks and hyphenation BEFORE validation
2. **Leading Articles:** Reject terms starting with "a", "an", "the"
3. **OCR Doubling:** Detect and reject doubled-character patterns
4. **Document Artifacts:** Reject section numbers, equations, citations

### HIGH (Should Fix - P1)
5. **Demonstratives:** Reject "these", "those", "this", "that" at start
6. **Question Words:** Reject "which", "what", "where", "when", "why", "how"
7. **Comparatives:** Reject "more", "less", "higher", "lower", "larger"
8. **Max Word Count:** Reduce from 4 to 3 words

### MEDIUM (Nice to Have - P2)
9. **Generic Singles:** Reject overly generic single words (time, end, air)
10. **Language Check:** Detect non-English characters if language='en'
11. **Quantifiers:** Reject "all", "any", "some", "many" at start

### LOW (Future Enhancement - P3)
12. **Semantic Validation:** Use NLP/ML to distinguish technical vs. common terms
13. **Domain Dictionary:** Maintain allowlist of known good terms
14. **User Feedback:** Let users mark terms as good/bad to train system

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes, test with:

### ✅ Should ACCEPT (Good Terms)
```python
good_terms = [
    "Mass Transfer Coefficient",
    "Particle Image Velocimetry",
    "Oxygen Transfer Rate",
    "Reynolds Number",
    "Construction Phase",
    "Single-Use Bioreactor",
    "Biotechnical Processes",
    "Validated Ka Models",
    "NAMUR",
    "ISO 9001",
]
```

### ❌ Should REJECT (Bad Terms)
```python
bad_terms = [
    "The Development",                    # Leading article
    "A Promising Approach",               # Leading article
    "Which Execution Approach",           # Question word
    "Tthhee Ssttiirrrreerr",             # OCR doubling
    "Minute\nH",                          # Line break
    "5.4 Example D",                      # Section number
    "= Eq",                               # Equation
    "These Plants",                       # Demonstrative
    "More Stringent Conditions",          # Comparative
    "Time",                               # Too generic single word
    "Flexibilität",                       # Foreign language
    "Kathrin Rübberdt",                   # Proper name
]
```

### Expected Results After Fixes:
- All 10 good terms should pass: 100% acceptance
- All 12 bad terms should fail: 100% rejection
- Questionable terms: Case-by-case (aim for 70%+ rejection)

## Conclusion

The TermValidator has a solid foundation but needs critical enhancements to be production-ready for technical glossary extraction. The main gaps are:

1. No preprocessing (line breaks, OCR errors)
2. Insufficient stop word checking (only checks whole term)
3. No document structure detection
4. No phrase-level linguistic rules

With the recommended P0 and P1 fixes, quality should improve from **D+ (42.5% bad)** to **B+ (5-10% bad)**.
