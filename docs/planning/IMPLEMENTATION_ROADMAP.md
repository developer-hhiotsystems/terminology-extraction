**Why PostgreSQL?**
- Full-text search (tsvector/tsquery)
- JSON field indexing and querying
- Better concurrency (multi-user)
- Production-proven scalability
- MAY eliminate need for Neo4j

**Phase 1: Schema Design (8 hours)**

Normalize data model:
```sql
-- Current: definitions stored as JSON array
-- New: Separate table with proper foreign keys

CREATE TABLE definitions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    glossary_entry_id INTEGER REFERENCES glossary_entries(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    source_doc_id INTEGER REFERENCES uploaded_documents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_glossary_fts ON glossary_entries
    USING gin(to_tsvector('english', term || ' ' || coalesce(description, '')));

CREATE INDEX idx_definitions_fts ON definitions
    USING gin(to_tsvector('english', text));
```

**Phase 2: Migration Scripts (12 hours)**

Create `scripts/migrate_to_postgres.py`:
1. Export SQLite data to JSON
2. Create PostgreSQL schema
3. Import and validate data
4. Run integrity checks
5. Performance benchmarks

**Phase 3: Application Updates (15 hours)**

Update files:
- `src/backend/config.py` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `src/backend/database.py` - Connection pooling
- `src/backend/models.py` - Schema changes

- Zero data loss

---

### Week 7: Relationship Extraction (20 hours)

**Critical for Neo4j Justification:**
Neo4j only makes sense with 5,000-8,000 relationship edges. Currently: 0 edges.

**Phase 1: Relationship Types (5 hours)**

Implement in `src/backend/services/relationship_extractor.py`:

```python
class RelationshipType(str, Enum):
    SYNONYM = "SYNONYM_OF"           # "Sensor" ↔ "Transducer"
    TRANSLATION = "TRANSLATION_OF"   # "Bioreactor" ↔ "Bioreaktor"
    PART_OF = "PART_OF"              # "Pressure Sensor" → "Sensor"
    RELATED_TO = "RELATED_TO"        # "Temperature" ↔ "Thermometer"
    USES = "USES"                    # "Bioreactor" → "Pressure Transmitter"
    MEASURES = "MEASURES"            # "Sensor" → "Temperature"

class RelationshipExtractor:
    def extract_synonyms(self, terms: List[str]) -> List[Tuple]:
        """Use word embeddings for semantic similarity"""
        # Threshold: cosine similarity > 0.85

    def extract_translations(self, en_terms: List, de_terms: List):
        """Match EN/DE pairs from same documents"""

    def extract_part_of(self, terms: List[str]):
        """Detect substring relationships"""
        # "Pressure Sensor" contains "Sensor"

    def extract_contextual(self, terms: List, documents: List):
        """Find co-occurrence relationships"""
        # Terms appearing together frequently in documents
```

**Phase 2: Semantic Similarity (8 hours)**

Use spaCy word vectors:
```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")  # Medium model with vectors

def calculate_similarity(term1: str, term2: str) -> float:
    doc1 = nlp(term1)
    doc2 = nlp(term2)
    return doc1.similarity(doc2)

# Example:
# "Sensor" vs "Transducer" → 0.72 (RELATED)
# "Bioreactor" vs "Fermentation Tank" → 0.81 (SYNONYM)
```

**Phase 3: Database Schema (2 hours)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE term_relationships (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source_term_id INTEGER REFERENCES glossary_entries(id),
    target_term_id INTEGER REFERENCES glossary_entries(id),
    relationship_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    confidence_score FLOAT CHECK (confidence_score BETWEEN 0 AND 1),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(source_term_id, target_term_id, relationship_type)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_source ON term_relationships(source_term_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_target ON term_relationships(target_term_id);
```

**Phase 4: Extraction & Validation (5 hours)**

Run relationship extraction:
```bash
python scripts/extract_relationships.py --min-confidence 0.75
```

Expected output:
- 1,500-2,000 synonym pairs
- 1,000-1,500 translation pairs (EN/DE)
- 500-1,000 part-of relationships
- 2,000-3,000 contextual relationships
- **Total: 5,000-7,500 edges** ✅ (Neo4j justified)

**Deliverables:**
- 5,000-8,000 relationship edges
- Confidence scores for validation
- PostgreSQL relationships table populated
- Ready for Neo4j IF performance requires graph database

## Decision Points

### Week 2: Cleanup Script Execution

**Decision:** Execute `scripts/cleanup_existing_bad_data.py`?

**Options:**
- **A) Execute now** (30 min) → 95%+ data quality, Week 2 100% complete
- **B) Test extraction first** (1-2h) → Extra validation before cleanup
- **C) Defer to Week 3** → Focus on test coverage instead

**Recommendation:** Option A - Quick win, high value

**Decision Criteria:**
- Do we trust the new validation rules? (Yes, tested)
- Is backup available? (Yes, SQLite file-based)
- Can we rollback? (Yes, copy database before cleanup)

---

### Week 8: Neo4j Go/No-Go

**Decision:** Proceed with Neo4j integration?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

**GO if:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL graph queries >1 second (performance bottleneck)
- ✅ 5,000+ relationship edges extracted (rich graph)
- ✅ User demand for graph visualization (business need)
- ✅ Team has Neo4j expertise or training complete

**NO-GO if:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL queries <1 second (sufficient performance)
- ❌ <3,000 relationship edges (sparse graph, not valuable)
- ❌ No user demand for graph features
- ❌ Operational complexity concerns (maintenance, cost)

**Alternative Path (No-Go):**
- Continue with PostgreSQL

## Implementation Best Practices

### Development Workflow

**Weekly Cycle:**
1. **Monday:** Review roadmap, select tasks for week
2. **Tuesday-Thursday:** Development + testing
3. **Friday:** Code review, deployment to staging, week retrospective

**Quality Gates:**
- All code must have tests (unit or integration)
- Test coverage cannot decrease
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- Security scan must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met

**Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/week-3-router-tests
# ... development ...
git commit -m "feat: Add glossary router integration tests"
git push origin feature/week-3-router-tests
# Create pull request → Review → Merge
```

### Testing Strategy

**Test Pyramid:**
```
        /\
       /E2E\           10% - Critical user flows
      /------\
     /  INT   \        30% - API + service integration
    /----------\
   /   UNIT     \      60% - Functions + methods
  /--------------\
```

**Continuous Integration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run backend tests
        run: pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
      - name: Check coverage threshold
        run: coverage report --fail-under=60
      - name: Run TypeScript checks
        run: npm run typecheck
```

### Documentation Standards

**Keep Updated:**
- README.md - Setup instructions
- docs/API.md - Endpoint documentation
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - System design
- docs/DEPLOYMENT.md - Production setup
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history

**For Each Major Change:**
- Update relevant documentation
- Add migration guide if breaking changes
- Record decision rationale

## Appendix

### A. Technology Decisions

**PostgreSQL vs SQLite:**
- **Chose PostgreSQL** for Month 2 because:
  - Full-text search (tsvector)
  - JSON indexing
  - Multi-user concurrency
  - Production scalability

**Neo4j vs PostgreSQL Recursive Queries:**
- **Evaluate at Week 8** based on:
  - Graph query performance (target: <1s)
  - Relationship density (need: 5,000+ edges)
  - Operational complexity vs value

**spaCy vs NLTK:**
- **Chose spaCy** because:
  - Better noun phrase extraction
  - Faster processing
  - Pre-trained models for EN/DE

## Final Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

**Priority 1: Execute Cleanup Script (30 min)**
```bash
venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\cleanup_existing_bad_data.py
```
→ 60% → 95%+ data quality achieved

**Priority 2: Begin Week 3 Tasks**
- Start router integration tests
- Create test plan document
- Set up CI/CD pipeline (if not already)

### Strategic Recommendations

**1. Follow the Phased Approach:**
Do NOT skip Month 1 foundation work. The expert team unanimously agreed that fixing data quality and test coverage MUST precede architectural changes.

**2. Trust the Prevention-First Work:**
The Week 1-2 extraction improvements will prevent 98%+ of bad data from being created. This was the right investment.

**3. Be Prepared to Skip Neo4j:**
If PostgreSQL graph queries perform adequately (<1s), staying with a single database will save:
- 80 hours development time
- Ongoing operational complexity
- Infrastructure costs
- Sync failure scenarios

**4. Focus on User Value:**
The UI/UX improvements in Month 2 will deliver immediate user value. Prioritize these alongside the database work.

**5. Maintain Momentum:**
You've invested 15 hours and achieved significant progress. The next 185 hours are well-structured with clear deliverables.

### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)

**Quarter 2 (Months 4-6):**
- DeepL API integration for translation
- IATE dataset validation
- Multi-user authentication
- Advanced NLP features (if needed)

**Quarter 3-4 (Months 7-12):**
- Machine learning for relationship prediction
- Mobile app (if user demand)
- API for third-party integrations
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)
