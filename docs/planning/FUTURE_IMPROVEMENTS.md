## ü§ñ AI/LLM-Assisted Features

### 1. Intelligent Definition Merging
**Status:** Planned for future phase
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium-High

**Problem:**
When a term appears in multiple documents with different definitions, we need a smart way to create a canonical, comprehensive definition.

**Current Implementation:**
- All definitions stored as array in database
- User sees all variants but no automated merging

**Proposed Solution:**
Use LLM (GPT-4, Claude, or local model) to:
1. Analyze all definition variants
2. Identify commonalities and differences
3. Generate a merged, comprehensive definition
4. Highlight conflicts or contradictions
5. Suggest the best combined definition for user approval

**Example Workflow:**
```
Input Definitions:
1. "Reactor - A vessel in which chemical reactions occur" (Doc1)
2. "Reactor - Container for processing materials" (Doc2)
3. "Reactor - Bioreactor system for cell cultivation" (Doc3)

LLM Analysis:
‚Üí Common theme: Container/vessel for controlled processes
‚Üí Variations: Chemical vs biological applications
‚Üí Contradiction: None detected

Suggested Merged Definition:
"Reactor - A vessel or container in which chemical or biological
reactions occur under controlled conditions. Can refer to chemical
reactors for material processing or bioreactors for cell cultivation."

User Action: ‚úì Approve | ‚úó Reject | ‚úèÔ∏è Edit
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Saves manual effort
- ‚úÖ Creates comprehensive definitions
- ‚úÖ Maintains consistency
- ‚úÖ Identifies contradictions automatically

**Technical Considerations:**
- API costs (OpenAI/Anthropic) vs local model
- Privacy/security (sending company terms to external API?)
- Batch processing vs real-time
- Confidence scoring for suggestions

**Related Features:**
- AI-suggested domain tags
- Context-aware translation improvements
- Automatic term relationship discovery

## üìä Data Quality & Management

### 2. Duplicate Term Detection & Resolution
**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Medium

**Problem:**
Terms might be duplicated across different sources with slight variations (e.g., "Bio-reactor" vs "Bioreactor").

**Proposed Solution:**
- Fuzzy matching algorithm
- Suggest merges to user
- Show similarity score

---

## üîç Search & Discovery

### 3. Advanced Search Features
**Status:** Ideas
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Low-Medium

**Ideas:**
- Search by page number: "Find all terms on page 5"
- Search by frequency: "Show terms appearing 10+ times"
- Cross-document search: "Terms in both Doc1 AND Doc2"
- Regex search support
- Search in context excerpts

---

## üìà Analytics & Reporting

### 4. Document Analytics Dashboard
**Status:** Ideas
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Medium

**Ideas:**
- Document similarity analysis
- Term overlap heatmap
- Most referenced documents
- Document coverage metrics

---

## üîó Integration Features

### 5. External API Integrations
**Status:** Future
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** High

**Ideas:**
- IATE terminology database integration (already planned)
- DeepL translation integration (already planned)
- Neo4j graph database (Phase 4 planned)
- SharePoint/DMS direct upload
- OCR for scanned PDFs

---

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### 6. Document Preview
**Status:** Ideas
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Medium

**Ideas:**
- PDF preview in browser
- Highlight term occurrences in preview
- Jump to specific page
- Side-by-side term and document view

---

## Notes

- Review this file quarterly to prioritize next features
- Mark items as "In Progress" when starting implementation
- Move completed items to PROGRESS.md with implementation details
